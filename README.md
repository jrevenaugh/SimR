# SimR

Shiny app to manage two players (initially) and compete (eventually) against a
player in the paper and pencils game Sim.

I see this one as a long-term project.  The idea would be to develop a code that
learns strategies (weighte decision tree for instance).  I'd also like it to be
able to mediate human play of higher vertices versions of Sim.
